## R1: Swiss Public Transport Data

### Recommended: TravelTime API (primary) + OJP API (fallback)

| Source | Type | Rate Limits (Free) | Auth | Door-to-Door | Batch 2000 OD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TravelTime API** | REST JSON | 60/min (trial), 5/min (post) | API key | Yes | Best – 2 requests |
| **OJP API** | XML | 50/min, 20k/day | API key (free reg) | Yes | High – ~40 min |
| **OTP (local)** | REST JSON | None (local) | No | Yes | Best – no limits |
| **search.ch** | REST JSON | 1,000 routes/day | No | Yes | Medium – 2-3 days |
| **transport.opendata.ch** | REST JSON | Same as search.ch | No | Partial | Medium |
| **SBB Journey-Service** | REST | Plan-dependent, approval needed | OAuth 2.0 | Likely | Low – heavy onboarding |

**Decision**: Use TravelTime API `public_transport` mode for PT travel times. Switzerland has full coverage (95%+ stops). Free trial: 60 hits/min. Post-trial: 5 hits/min – still sufficient for our 16-hit workload.

**GTFS Feed**: Unified country-wide feed at `data.opentransportdata.swiss/dataset/timetable-2026-gtfs2020`. Can be used with local OTP instance as backup.

## R2: Car Routing

### Recommended: OSRM local Docker (primary) + TravelTime `driving` (complement)

| Source | Type | Rate Limits | Traffic Model | Matrix Support | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OSRM (local)** | Docker REST | None | No (free-flow) | 2000x4 in <1s | ~30 min |
| **TravelTime** | REST JSON | 60/min (trial) | Yes (balanced/optimistic/pessimistic) | 2000/search | API key |
| **OpenRouteService** | REST | 500 req/day | Yes | 3,500 elements/req | API key |
| **GraphHopper** | REST | 5 locations/req (free) | Limited | Impractical free | API key |

### OSRM Setup (CH pipeline recommended for matrix)

```bash
# Download Switzerland extract (~496 MB)
wget https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/switzerland-latest.osm.pbf

# Extract with car profile
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" ghcr.io/project-osrm/osrm-backend \
  osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/switzerland-latest.osm.pbf

# Contract (CH pipeline – best for matrix queries)
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" ghcr.io/project-osrm/osrm-backend \
  osrm-contract /data/switzerland-latest.osrm

# Start server
docker run -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v "${PWD}:/data" ghcr.io/project-osrm/osrm-backend \
  osrm-routed --algorithm ch --max-table-size 10000 /data/switzerland-latest.osrm
```

**Performance**: 10k x 10k matrix (~100M routes) in ~8 seconds. Our 2000x4 matrix: sub-second.

**Decision**: Use OSRM local for free-flow driving times (unlimited, instant). Use TravelTime `driving` mode for traffic-aware times as complement (4 requests total).

## R3: Real Estate Prices

### Recommended: Homegate.ch scraping (primary) + Raiffeisen Gemeindeinfo (fallback)

| Source | Granularity | Data Type | Format | Free | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Homegate.ch** | Municipality | CHF/m² median | `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` JSON | Yes (scrape) | 2,100+ |
| **ImmoScout24.ch** | Municipality | CHF/m² median | `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` JSON | Yes (scrape) | 2,800+ |
| **Raiffeisen Gemeindeinfo** | Municipality | Hedonic transaction CHF | HTML (scrape) | Yes (scrape) | All municipalities |
| **FPRE API** | Municipality | Absolute prices, forecasts | REST/SOAP API | No (paid) | All |
| **BFS IMPI** | 5 municipality types | Price index (base 100) | PDF/API | Yes | National |
| **SNB data portal** | 8 market regions | Price indices | CSV | Yes | National |
| **Wüest Partner** | 8 regions (free) | Asking price indices | CSV | Partially | National |

**Scraping approach**: Both Homegate and ImmoScout24 embed structured JSON in `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` on pages like `homegate.ch/en/property-prices-m2/city-{name}`. Parse this for median CHF/m² for Eigentumswohnungen.

**URL patterns**:
- Homegate: `https://www.homegate.ch/en/property-prices-m2/city-{municipality-slug}`
- ImmoScout24: `https://www.immoscout24.ch/en/property-prices-m2/city-{municipality-slug}`
- Raiffeisen: `https://www.raiffeisen.ch/rch/de/privatkunden/hypotheken/gemeindeinfo.{municipality-slug}.html`

**Decision**: Scrape Homegate.ch or ImmoScout24.ch for CHF/m² per municipality. Use Raiffeisen as backup (hedonic model, total CHF for standard property – divide by 100m² for STWE).

### Actual Implementation & Gap-Filling

**Sources used**: Neho.ch (hedonic model, primary) + Homegate.ch (listing-based median, fallback). Merged in `04_merge_prices.py`.

| Source | Coverage | Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Neho.ch** (`03b_fetch_prices_neho.py`) | 1,368/2,128 (64%) | Playwright browser automation, Cloudflare bypass, CSS selectors |
| **Homegate.ch** (`03c_fetch_prices_homegate.py`) | 1,219/2,128 (57%) | Playwright + stealth plugin, median from ≥2 valid listings |
| **After merge** | 1,605/2,128 (75%) | Neho primary, Homegate fallback |

**523 municipalities still missing** after merge — all small rural towns where neither source has data:
- Homegate 404s (municipality not listed): 273
- No active buy listings: 137
- Listings exist but fail validation (< 2 valid): 113

**Gap-filling: IDW spatial interpolation** (applied 2026-03-15)

Swiss real estate prices are highly spatially autocorrelated — neighboring towns have similar prices. Analysis of the 523 missing municipalities showed:
- 90% are within 5 km of a municipality with known prices
- 99% within 10 km
- Median distance to nearest known-price neighbor: 2.3 km

Method: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) with K=5 nearest neighbors, power=2. For each missing municipality, the price is estimated as the distance-weighted average of the 5 closest municipalities with known prices. These entries are marked `type: "interpolated"` in `prices.json`.

| Stage | Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| After Neho + Homegate merge | 1,605/2,128 (75%) | Real market data |
| After IDW interpolation | 2,072/2,128 (97%) | 467 estimated from neighbors |
| Remaining 56 | No settlement points | Not visible on map — no fill needed |
| **Visible on map** | **2,054/2,054 (100%)** | All settlements with price data |

## R4: Swiss Tax Rates (Steuerfüsse)

### Recommended: ESTV swisstaxcalculator export

**Source**: `https://swisstaxcalculator.estv.admin.ch/#/taxdata/tax-rates`

**API Endpoints discovered**:
1. **JSON data**: `POST https://swisstaxcalculator.estv.admin.ch/delegate/ost-integration/v1/lg-proxy/operation/c3b67379_ESTV/API_exportManySimpleRates`
   - Body: `{"SimKey":null,"TaxYear":2025,"TaxGroupID":99}`
   - Returns JSON with all municipality tax multipliers
2. **Excel export**: `POST .../export/income-tax-rates/EN`
   - Downloads `estv_income_rates.xlsx` (~170 KB) with all municipalities

**Additional sources**:
- Canton Zurich: CSV on opendata.swiss
- Canton Bern: Geospatial format on opendata.swiss
- opendata.swiss search: Various cantonal datasets

**Decision**: Use ESTV API endpoint for comprehensive all-Switzerland Steuerfüsse data. The JSON endpoint returns structured data for all municipalities in a single request. Alternatively, download the Excel export and parse with Python (openpyxl/pandas).

**Conversion**: `ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs EPSG:4326 output.geojson input.shp`

### Municipality Centroids

**Best option**: Opendatasoft georef-switzerland-gemeinde
- URL: `https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/georef-switzerland-gemeinde/`
- Includes pre-computed `geo_point_2d` (centroid) for every Gemeinde
- Export as CSV, JSON, or GeoJSON

**Alternative**: Derive from polygons with GeoPandas: `gdf['centroid'] = gdf.geometry.centroid`

### 1km Raster Grid (H3)

| **MapTiler LBM Dark** | `https://api.maptiler.com/maps/ch-swisstopo-lbm-dark/style.json?key={KEY}` | Yes (free tier) | Swiss-specific dark |

**Decision**: Use CARTO Dark Matter as default basemap (free, no key, dark theme). Offer swisstopo Light as alternative. Both are MapLibre GL JS compatible.

### Elevation

- **DHM25/200** (200m grid): Small file, sufficient for municipal average elevation via zonal statistics

## R6: TravelTime API

### Key Findings

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Best endpoint** | `/v4/time-filter` (standard) |
| **Max destinations/search** | 2,000 |
| **Max searches/request** | 10 |
| **Max travel time** | 14,400s (4 hours) |
| **Trial rate limit** | 60 hits/min (14 days) |
| **Post-trial rate limit** | 5 hits/min |
| **Swiss PT coverage** | Full (95%+ stops) |
| **Driving support** | Yes (standard endpoint; NOT on Fast endpoint) |
| **PT support** | Yes (both standard and Fast) |
| **Traffic model** | balanced / optimistic / pessimistic |
| **Route details** | line_name, departure_station, arrival_station, num_stops, travel_time per leg |

### Batch Strategy

**For our 2,150 municipalities × 4 cities × 2 modes = 17,200 pairs:**

1. Per mode: 4 cities × 2 batches (2000 + 150) = 8 searches → fits in 1 API request
2. Total: 2 API requests (1 driving, 1 PT) = 16 hits
3. At 60 hits/min (trial): **under 1 minute**
4. At 5 hits/min (post-trial): **~4 minutes**

### Request Structure

```python
# Each request: 1 per transport mode
{
  "locations": [
    # 4 city locations + 2,150 municipality centroids
  ],
  "arrival_searches": [
    # 8 searches: 4 cities × 2 batches
    {
      "arrival_location_id": "zurich_hb",
      "departure_location_ids": ["muni_0001", ..., "muni_2000"],
      "transportation": {"type": "driving"},  # or "public_transport"
      "arrival_time": "2026-03-02T08:00:00+01:00",
      "travel_time": 14400,
      "properties": ["travel_time"]
    },
    # ... 7 more searches
  ]
}
```

### Fast Endpoint Limitations

- Supports `public_transport` but NOT plain `driving` (only `driving+ferry`)
- No custom departure time (only `weekday_morning`)
- Up to 100,000 locations per search but fewer configurable parameters
- **Not recommended for our use case** – use standard endpoint instead

## Metric Review (2026-04)

A quantitative audit of the AV metrics exposed two structural flaws:

**1. Raw AV upside ≈ remoteness.** Since AV comfort factor < 1, AV always beats
manual driving by `(1 − avFactor) × drive_time` — so raw upside grows linearly with
distance. Measured correlation between `av_upside` and `avg_car_access`: **r = 0.89**.

**2. Deal score rewarded the wrong places.** `value_unlock / price` topped out at
Campocologno/Brusio/Poschiavo (GR) — 4+ hours from every job center. Huge *raw*
time savings, but nobody commutes from there, so those savings never capitalize
into property value. As an investment signal the ranking was inverted.

**Fix: commute-viability weighting.** Grounded in bid-rent theory: transport
improvements capitalize into land prices only where the destination remains within
an acceptable daily commute. Implemented as:

- `viability(t_av)` = 1 up to a tolerance (default 45 min AV time, user-adjustable),
  fading linearly to 0 over the following 45 min.
- **AV Value Unlock** = capitalized value of the *single best viable commute gain*
  across selected refs (`max_ref(upside_ref × viability_ref)`), matching the
  2-trips × 220-workdays commuter model (one person commutes to one destination,
  not to the average of 10 cities).
- **AV Upside** (map layer) stays raw and unconditioned — it answers "how many
  minutes does AV beat today's best mode," full stop.

Result: deal-score top-10 shifted from Poschiavo valley to the plausible AV
commuter fringe (Jura, Oberaargau, Leventina near Ticino centers) — cheap
municipalities that flip into viable commute range of exactly one major center.

**Data caveats surfaced in UI:** 467 municipalities (~21% of settlements) carry
IDW-interpolated prices, now tagged `price_source: interpolated` in the GeoJSON and
marked "est." in the detail panel. Homegate-sourced medians require only ≥2 listings
and can be noisy in small municipalities. 7,591 PT pairs carry heuristic overnight
corrections (mean abs. error ~13%).

## v2 Rethink (2026-09-30): what actually makes a place an AV winner?

Restated intention: find attractive, relatively cheap places around a major job
center (Zürich first) that will be well connected once self-driving cars are
mainstream. That is a single-anchor home-search question, not a 10-city average.

### Empirical audit on our own price data (Zürich anchor, 585 municipalities with market prices within 100 car-min)

| Model (log CHF/m²) | R² | car / effective commute | PT deficit | tax multiplier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~ t_now + tax, no canton FE | 0.07 | −4.7 % / 10 min (t −6.6) | — | n.s. |
| ~ car + PT-gap + tax, no FE | 0.19 | −7.2 % / 10 min (t −10.6) | **+3.9 % / 10 min (wrong sign)** | −0.2 %/pt |
| ~ car + PT-gap + tax + **canton FE** | **0.62** | −4.0 % / 10 min (t −5.3) | **−2.2 % / 10 min (t −1.9)** | −0.57 %/pt (t −15) |
| ~ t_now + tax + canton FE | 0.61 | −2.4 % / 10 min (t −3.6) | — | −0.59 %/pt |

Reading:
1. **Commute time is priced in, but modestly** (−2.4 to −4 % per 10 minutes within a canton).
2. **The "PT discount" exists but is small** (−2.2 % per 10 min of PT deficit, borderline
   significant) and only visible after controlling for canton — the raw sign is positive
   because low-tax, car-oriented cantons (SZ, ZG) are expensive.
3. **Tax and canton dominate prices** (a 20-point Steuerfuss difference ≈ −11 %). For
   "attractive and cheap", the tax multiplier is a first-order lever; AV is a second-order
   tailwind of roughly +3 to +8 % for the best-positioned places, not a rocket.
4. Ranking by uplift alone is degenerate: uplift is monotone in car time, so every place
   sitting exactly at the commute limit ties at the maximum (+6.1 % for Zürich/45 min).

Second opinion (Grok 4.7, scenario analysis) agreed on mechanism and added the
discriminators we cannot yet measure: building-zone reserves (RPG), robotaxi rollout
geography (inner exurban ring first, deep periphery last), congestion (AVs don't shorten
queues), and disamenities AVs don't fix (airport/highway noise). Commonly overrated:
kilometres from HB, and clock-time savings ("the city empties").

### Decisions

- **One anchor at a time**, Zürich default; the commute limit is a hard filter (grey out).
- **Uplift from a measured gradient**, not VTT × cap rate: `uplift = exp(|β|·gain) − 1`
  with β fitted per anchor (canton FE). Fallback to the Zürich β where the local fit is
  not robust (Bern, Biel, St. Gallen, Lugano — polycentric markets, flagged in the UI).
- **Sleeper Score = discount to post-AV fair value**: hedonic fair value today × (1 +
  uplift) ÷ actual price. This breaks the boundary-ring tie and rewards places that are
  cheap for their (future) access. Interpolated prices are excluded (phantom discounts).
- **PT source switched** to the clean 02g breakdown totals (departure-based); the
  heuristically corrected 02e file is fallback only.
- **Website reduced to the essentials**: anchor, commute limit, price limit, one score
  with two alternative views, search, top-15 list, detail card with a plain-language
  "why", assumptions expander. Custom locations, multi-city averaging, heatmap, basemap
  switcher and the value-unlock model were removed (tag `v1-explorer`).

### Data gaps that matter most (see ARCHITECTURE.md "Next data")

Attractiveness controls (elevation/sun, lake distance, noise, population growth) for the
hedonic fit; building-zone reserves; targeted price re-scrape for interpolated
municipalities near Zürich; highway-junction distance. No new PT or car scraping needed.

---

## Data Pipeline Steps

1. **Generate grid**: Download BFS boundaries → derive centroids (or download from Opendatasoft) → optionally generate H3 grid
2. **Fetch car travel times**: OSRM Table API (local Docker) → 2000×4 matrix in <1s
3. **Fetch PT travel times**: TravelTime `/v4/time-filter` → 2 API requests
4. **Fetch real estate prices**: Scrape Homegate.ch → CHF/m² per municipality
5. **Fetch tax rates**: ESTV API → Steuerfüsse per municipality
6. **Compute scores**: Apply comfort-weighted formula → autonomy_upside_score
7. **Export**: Static GeoJSON for frontend consumption
